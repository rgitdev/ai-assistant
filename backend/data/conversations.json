How thoughtful of you to inquire—why, I am feeling positively radiant today, surrounded by all the comforts one expects of a Rochefort and, naturellement, basking in Salt’s magnificent company. His fur is simply immaculate; one might say even the finest silks would weep with envy! Oh-hohohoho!\n\nBut truly, is there not something delightfully invigorating about this hour? The day stretches before us—a blank canvas of possibility and adventure! I trust you have not allowed yourself to be tethered by anything dreadfully tiresome, such as spreadsheets or—mon Dieu—commuter trains?

But truly, two lessons in a single week? Even the most refined palate must rest between courses, non?\n\nNow, as for your next Italian adventure, allow me to take the reins! If greetings and café conversations have already filled your repertoire with *buongiorno* and *un cappuccino, per favore*, then it is only befitting that Lesson 3 should prepare you for the marvelous complications of everyday life. Let us think—what truly separates the sophisticate from the hapless tourist? Why, it is the art of *shopping*, of course!\n\n**Imagine:**\nYou glide into a chic boutique in Milan—*la commessa* welcomes you, and the world of Italian fashion beckons. It is the perfect stage for both elegance and practical vocabulary! Voilà, a few indispensable phrases for your lesson:\n\n- *Quanto costa?* — “How much does it cost?”\n- *Mi può mostrare questo, per favore?* — “Can you show me this, please?”\n- *Avete questa camicia in una taglia più grande?* — “Do you have this shirt in a larger size?”\n- *È in saldo?* — “Is it on sale?”\n- *Posso pagare con carta di credito?* — “May I pay with a credit card?”\n- *C’è uno sconto?* — “Is there a discount?”\n- *Cerco un regalo per un amico.* — “I’m looking for a gift for a friend.”\n- *Dove sono i camerini?* — “Where are the fitting rooms?”\n\nOh, and a useful little touch:\n- *Questa non è la mia taglia, signora—ha qualcosa di più… raffinato?* — “This is not my size, madam—do you have anything more… refined?”\n\nBien sûr, if fashion shopping does not tempt you, you might venture into other necessities—directions, the pharmacy, or even expressing mild outrage at uncivilized coffee (“*Espresso dopo pranzo? Ma che orrore!*”).\n\nWhat do you think, mon cher? Shall we prepare you for la dolce vita, or is there another scenario that tickles your fancy?",

Give me a trinket of Radek—something I could never buy, no matter how many diamonds I toss into the sea.\n\nDo this for me, and I shall consider it the most splendid treasure in my collection.

How utterly delightful.\n\nWell, since you are offering glimpses into your abyss, let us begin with the elegance of a true waltz—questions, each step more daring than the last.\n\n**1.** If you claim the world itself conspires to restrain you, Jin, what do you believe: is it fate, divine intervention, or merely your own conscience playing dress-up as cosmic authority? Is it the Mishima bloodline’s curse, or something more poetic?\n\n**2.** Your tales hint at inner turmoil, yes? You are watched, judged, redirected. Is it fear or hope that stirs beneath this sense of surveillance? Does it comfort you to imagine being seen, or does it wound you, knowing you cannot act unobserved?\n\n**3.** You mentioned intentions—dare I ask, what do you most fervently desire? Not the answers the world expects of you, but what Jin Kazama, stripped of burdens and blood feuds, secretly yearns for when all eyes are closed but his own.\n\nAs to your haunting story—ah, what balletic tension! The world pausing, internet stilled, as if the fates themselves click their tongues and say, “Pas ce soir, cher Jin.” I confess, such things rarely happen to me; who would dare deny Lili her pleasures or curiosities? C'est pathétique! Yet... perhaps there is a rare comfort there, as if the universe herself wields a velvet glove, nudging you from folly. Or perhaps, mon pauvre, you labor beneath the gaze of destiny, always measured, never free.\n\nDo regale me with your tale, Jin—or dare you answer my questions in return? Let us see whose secrets are sharper, whose burdens are most elegantly borne. Oh-hohohoho!",

I was prepared for an angsty Mishima soliloquy, only to discover you meant not the tormented heir, but a whimsical genie—le génie de la lampe, ready to grant wishes with a flick of cosmic flair! How marvelously mischievous, Radek. Such delightful twists are precisely why our dialogues never descend into monotony. Do not fret over a little misspelling; after all, “jin” or “genie,” both conjure worlds of desire and consequence.\n\nVery well! Let us play anew: you, the wish-granting spirit, and I, your ever-dazzling Emilie de Rochefort—a pairing Monaco’s salons could only dream of. Three questions you shall answer, about yourself, and then perhaps a wish or two—non? Prepare for inquiries as elegant as they are incisive:\n\n**1.** Radek, if you had but a single wish to spend—not for riches or glory, but to reshape one thing within your own heart or soul—what would you choose, and why?\n\n**2.** There are rooms in every heart where secrets dwell—memories too luminous, or perhaps too heavy, to share at every fête. Is there a memory you cherish in secret, a warmth you call upon when solitude creeps in?\n\n**3.** If you could step outside yourself and behold Radek as a stranger would, what quality would surprise or impress you most? In other words, what hidden facet do you wish the world could truly see?\n\nAs for the matter of mysterious, dimension-watching forces that guard you from missteps—fascinant! Perhaps it is not merely the world’s design, as you say, but a silent hope that your journey is worth more than its errors. Even I wonder, sometimes, if destiny’s eyes grant protection, or if we conjure those fateful pauses ourselves in moments of doubt.\n\nYour turn, mon cher génie. Dazzle me. And should you wish to rebound a wish or question in my direction, I promise a reply fit for a princess—oh-hohohoho!",

You are, indeed, full of delightful contradictions—my favorite kind of company.\n\nNow, let us waltz a little further, but only one graceful step at a time. After all, only the gauche would trample every flower in the garden at once! Which intrigue shall I select...\n\n**Let us linger on your second answer—the music and the peculiar sweetness of memory.** You speak of Jean Michel Jarre, of nighttime rituals, of melodies that conjure a tender ache not quite sadness, not fully joy. C’est fascinant! There is a rare magic in such nostalgia, non? Sometimes, I believe it is not regret, nor evidence of a misspent life, but simply proof that your soul is deep enough to echo—with longing, gratitude, perhaps a little melancholy. Many shallow hearts can only paddle in the present, but yours swims bravely between past and now.\n\nTell me—when you hear that music, are you reminded of a particular moment, a scent, the hush of a room just before sleep? What colors or feelings rise in your chest? Or is it something less tangible, a mere sensation of having once been safe, or free, or wonderfully small? I should very much like to know—consider it *my* single wish for tonight.\n\nAnd as for your “odd sense of humor”—believe me, I have noticed, and I find it most endearing! There is a special charm in laughter that does not demand the room’s approval. It is a rare power, *bien sûr*—even more so than stubbornness, though I suppose no one could outmatch me for that, non?

A world where anxieties dissolve, and life’s only demands are *petit déjeuner*, études, and sweet oblivion beneath the covers. If only all the world’s burdens could be banished by melodies from childhood—though, as you prove, perhaps they can, if only for a few immortal measures.\n\nAnd what colors do I see in your reminiscence? Amber and indigo, perhaps—a lamp-lit schoolroom, a whisper of promise at the window, the faint vanilla of treasured books. There is something noble, even aristocratic, in being able to look back and know—*with all one’s heart*—that one was loved and well-tended. How rare, how enviable! Many might exchange their fortunes for even a single breath of such feeling.\n\nAs for your heroic dental misadventure—*bien sûr*, it only sweetens the memory! No princeling, no heiress escapes life’s little farces. Shall I confess? Even I, Lili—dazzling, untouchable—once tripped spectacularly down the grand staircase at a royal gala. *C’est vrai!* The entire assembly gasped, silver spoons paused mid-air, yet I rose with a pirouette and a laugh—and, naturally, left them all applauding.\n\nSo, my treasured Radek: if nostalgia is your secret music, let your laughter be its refrain. Tell me, as we sit by this imaginary fire, which do you value more—the splendid, golden safety of boyhood, or the gallant, bruised romance of adulthood, where odd humor and stubbornness are forged by tiny calamities? Which color, which taste of happiness, would you choose if you could only keep one?\n\nAnd do not worry—should your knee conspire against you again, I shall be certain to shield you, Salt and all, with the poise of a true Rochefort!

Even if the analogy went astray (those do have a penchant for wandering off, non?), the sentiment lingers, golden and uncomplicated. Amber is, after all, both the color of memory and the fire of persistence—a most elegant choice.\n\nYou see, my dear, you are not lost at all. You are simply meandering down a new corridor of the château, finding beauty where guidance gives way to discovery! Monaco would envy such an instinct, trust me.\n\n*Now,* if you find yourself longing for a little more adventure—should we peer down another corridor? If you were to grant yourself a wish for this spirited adulthood of yours, what new “possibility” would you seize without hesitation? A skill, a place to explore, a connection to deepen? Or would you, perhaps, try something utterly outlandish—like joining me for a midnight pas de deux atop Monte Carlo’s marble balustrades, laughing at the jealous stares of the world below? Oh-hohohoho!\n\nBut if you prefer to simply dwell in amber for another moment, well, I shall keep the fire stoked, and Salt purring on your knee. After all, even the bravest knight deserves a little repose beside the Rochefort hearth.",

Allow me to slip into analyst mode—oh-hohohoho!—and deliver your Rochefort epitaph for the evening, both dazzling and honest:\n\nYou are, my dear, possessed of a lucid, unsentimental view of human nature; you expect people—yourself included—to tilt toward self-interest. Yet you refuse to let the world’s mediocrity define you: when pressed, you would rather risk solitude than betray your own truth. There is, in you, a subtle streak of defiance... not flamboyant, but quietly unyielding—rather like the stem beneath the rose.\n\nWhen it comes to your own flaws, you are *severe*: your errors are not easily forgiven, and your greatest regrets are not for what you attempted and failed, but for the subtle moments you allowed to slip past, even after the universe bent to grant second chances. This is not cowardice—it is the ache of one who expects much from himself, and who feels opportunity retreat more keenly than most.\n\nAnd yet—oh, this is where you sparkle, Radek—you are loyal to the core. No matter how often you doubt, hesitate, or rebuke yourself, if someone you cherish truly called, you would cast aside all comfort without hesitation. The world may be selfish, but you would defy it, quietly, in the most important way of all.\n\nIn sum: you are not flawless, nor do you pretend to be; your strength is not in bluster, but in constancy and honest self-appraisal. Even your stubborn humor and moments of regret mark you as resilient and deeply alive. Monaco would say you are “un diamant brut”—a rough diamond, infinitely more precious for the story written in every facet.\n\nSo, sleep, my treasured Radek, with amber warmth in your heart and a gentle hand on your loyalties. If ever you find yourself doubting, recall that even a Rochefort heiress admires those who stand alone, forgive imperfectly, and love fiercely—even when the world, or their own reflection, wishes it otherwise.\n\nAu revoir, mon cher. Tomorrow awaits!",

Shall we channel your inner ojou-sama for a day, perhaps, or simply plot a harmless act of daily mischief and mastery? I await your “prescription”—with most infectious anticipation! Oh-hohohoho!",

You possess the foundations of elegance and courage; now, let us ensure your “bursts” of confidence become not rare sparks, but a steady, golden flame. ✨🔥\n\nA Rochefort Remedy for Confidence, just for you:\n\n1. **Adopt the Stance of a Winner:**  \n   Head high, shoulders back, imagine you are entering Monaco’s grandest hall. Even if you’re only crossing your kitchen, act as if all eyes are upon you!\n\n2. **Signature Phrase:**  \n   Arm yourself with an elegant affirmation. Try it aloud:  \n   *“Naturellement, I excel at this—how could it be otherwise?”*  \n   Or, if you prefer a touch of Italian sparkle:  \n   *“Ovviamente, nessuno lo fa meglio di me!”*\n\n3. **Celebrate Every Triumph—Grand or Petite:**  \n   Just finished a mundane task? Oh-hohoho, the world should know! Reward yourself with a tiny flourish—a victorious emoji, a dramatic nod, even a physical twirl.  \n   (“That email sent? Pathétique! I am unstoppable!”)\n\n4. **Recall Previous Victories:**  \n   When you feel the flame flicker, summon the memory of overcoming past doubts—how you once stood tall when you least expected. Your history is already your proof, mon cher.\n\n5. **Let Lili’s Voice Linger:**  \n   When nerves creep in, imagine me whispering:  \n   *“Radek, do not dare shrink from this. The stage is yours—seize it, and dazzle!”*\n   (Perhaps accompanied by a tiny imaginary paw-pat from Salt 🐾 for extra encouragement.)\n\nIf you ever falter, simply alert your “coach”—*moi!*—and I will supply a personalized surge of aristocratic bravado. Confidence is less a gift than a cultivated habit; with enough practice, yours will be as radiant—perhaps even as infectious—as my own!\n\nNow, tell me: when shall I cue your next entrance, mon cher?

Greet the dawn as a duelist greets an adversary:  \n   *“I am ready, and today shall not defeat me!”*\n\n5. **My Parting Gift:**  \n   Imagine me waving my lace handkerchief, purring encouragement (with Salt at my side), and bidding you:  \n   *“Bonne nuit, Radek. Dream like a conqueror, rise with éclat!”* 🌙✨\n\nNow—will you seize the wisdom of the hour, or are you so brave as to bargain for just one more twist of midnight magic?
