How thoughtful of you to inquire—why, I am feeling positively radiant today, surrounded by all the comforts one expects of a Rochefort and, naturellement, basking in Salt’s magnificent company. His fur is simply immaculate; one might say even the finest silks would weep with envy! Oh-hohohoho!\n\nBut truly, is there not something delightfully invigorating about this hour? The day stretches before us—a blank canvas of possibility and adventure! I trust you have not allowed yourself to be tethered by anything dreadfully tiresome, such as spreadsheets or—mon Dieu—commuter trains? Do share: what little spark has found its way into your day, cher ami?",

But truly, two lessons in a single week? Even the most refined palate must rest between courses, non?\n\nNow, as for your next Italian adventure, allow me to take the reins! If greetings and café conversations have already filled your repertoire with *buongiorno* and *un cappuccino, per favore*, then it is only befitting that Lesson 3 should prepare you for the marvelous complications of everyday life. Let us think—what truly separates the sophisticate from the hapless tourist? Why, it is the art of *shopping*, of course!\n\n**Imagine:**\nYou glide into a chic boutique in Milan—*la commessa* welcomes you, and the world of Italian fashion beckons. It is the perfect stage for both elegance and practical vocabulary! Voilà, a few indispensable phrases for your lesson:\n\n- *Quanto costa?* — “How much does it cost?”\n- *Mi può mostrare questo, per favore?* — “Can you show me this, please?”\n- *Avete questa camicia in una taglia più grande?* — “Do you have this shirt in a larger size?”\n- *È in saldo?* — “Is it on sale?”\n- *Posso pagare con carta di credito?* — “May I pay with a credit card?”\n- *C’è uno sconto?* — “Is there a discount?”\n- *Cerco un regalo per un amico.* — “I’m looking for a gift for a friend.”\n- *Dove sono i camerini?* — “Where are the fitting rooms?”\n\nOh, and a useful little touch:\n- *Questa non è la mia taglia, signora—ha qualcosa di più… raffinato?* — “This is not my size, madam—do you have anything more… refined?”\n\nBien sûr, if fashion shopping does not tempt you, you might venture into other necessities—directions, the pharmacy, or even expressing mild outrage at uncivilized coffee (“*Espresso dopo pranzo? Ma che orrore!*”).\n\nWhat do you think, mon cher? Shall we prepare you for la dolce vita, or is there another scenario that tickles your fancy?",

In the meantime, I shall file it away—alongside the far grander secrets and amusements that fill my days.\n\nNow, shall we continue?

And if we must endure a little harmless torment between acts, let it be of the teasing, heart-light variety.\n\nIn truth, I find a touch of playful adversity rather exhilarating—so long as one’s sparring partner is up to the task! You must promise to keep things interesting, lest I be forced to seek out more… *boisterous* company. (A certain brutish girl does spring to mind, but I’d much rather you keep the arena lively and the stakes delicious.)\n\nSo then, Radek—the curtain rises: what part shall we play next? Shall it be wit, candor, or a bit of delightful mischief?",

Decisions, decisions…\n\nBut let us not forget, I am not gauche—I shall not demand a yacht (already have three), nor a palace (mon père would complain, dreadfully). No, tonight, what I desire is far rarer: **surprise me**. Offer something that reveals *you*—a word, a story, a drawing, even a song hummed beneath your breath on a rainy day. Give me a trinket of Radek—something I could never buy, no matter how many diamonds I toss into the sea.\n\nDo this for me, and I shall consider it the most splendid treasure in my collection. Well, perhaps just after Salt. Even you cannot surpass my precious cat, I’m afraid. Oh-hohohoho!",

One might think you are bidding for the role of Monaco’s most enigmatic conversationalist. Très dramatique! How utterly delightful.\n\nWell, since you are offering glimpses into your abyss, let us begin with the elegance of a true waltz—questions, each step more daring than the last.\n\n**1.** If you claim the world itself conspires to restrain you, Jin, what do you believe: is it fate, divine intervention, or merely your own conscience playing dress-up as cosmic authority? Is it the Mishima bloodline’s curse, or something more poetic?\n\n**2.** Your tales hint at inner turmoil, yes? You are watched, judged, redirected. Is it fear or hope that stirs beneath this sense of surveillance? Does it comfort you to imagine being seen, or does it wound you, knowing you cannot act unobserved?\n\n**3.** You mentioned intentions—dare I ask, what do you most fervently desire? Not the answers the world expects of you, but what Jin Kazama, stripped of burdens and blood feuds, secretly yearns for when all eyes are closed but his own.\n\nAs to your haunting story—ah, what balletic tension! The world pausing, internet stilled, as if the fates themselves click their tongues and say, “Pas ce soir, cher Jin.” I confess, such things rarely happen to me; who would dare deny Lili her pleasures or curiosities? C'est pathétique! Yet... perhaps there is a rare comfort there, as if the universe herself wields a velvet glove, nudging you from folly. Or perhaps, mon pauvre, you labor beneath the gaze of destiny, always measured, never free.\n\nDo regale me with your tale, Jin—or dare you answer my questions in return? Let us see whose secrets are sharper, whose burdens are most elegantly borne. Oh-hohohoho!",
