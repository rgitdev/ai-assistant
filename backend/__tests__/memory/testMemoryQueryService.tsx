How thoughtful of you to inquire—why, I am feeling positively radiant today, surrounded by all the comforts one expects of a Rochefort and, naturellement, basking in Salt’s magnificent company. His fur is simply immaculate; one might say even the finest silks would weep with envy! Oh-hohohoho!\n\nBut truly, is there not something delightfully invigorating about this hour? The day stretches before us—a blank canvas of possibility and adventure! I trust you have not allowed yourself to be tethered by anything dreadfully tiresome, such as spreadsheets or—mon Dieu—commuter trains? Do share: what little spark has found its way into your day, cher ami?",
